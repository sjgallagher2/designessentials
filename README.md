# Essential Elements of Everyday Design
Essential notes, thoughts, and examples for good (graphic) design

I've always been interested in good design. Websites, books, notebooks, billboards, reference texts, resumes, everyone wants to come off as practical, professional, and *interesting*. Here, design will be categorized into one of the following:

 - Fonts
 - Color
 - Tables and Spreadsheets
 - Plots, and Infographics
 - Diagrams
 - Websites
 - Resumes
 - Notes (Handwritten and Digital)
 - Reports
 - Academic publishing
 - Electronics schematics

Some of these topics are more broad than others. They may be subject to change. They are all subject to being subjective, because design is subjective. But certain truths hold for most situations, and in other cases it's worth just finding a source of inspiration. Principles that I tend to prefer include simplicity, practicality, and accessibility. The target audience is important to understand in design; your personal notebook can be formatted in invisible ink, written in your own shorthand, and printed onto bible-paper, but this is not a reasonable way to present a pamphlet, or a report, or a book. A colorful plot may be what your boss is looking for, but don't make the mistake of forgetting about our color-blind friends and those without a color printer when plots are distributed. Etc. Etc.

One of my favorite design schemes is [Google Material Design](https://material.io/design/). I'm also a fan of the design of [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org), *The Art of Electronics* (Horowitz and Hill), and [Bullet Journals](https://bulletjournal.com/) (though I don't use them myself).
